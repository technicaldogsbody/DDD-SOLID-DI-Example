# DDD-SOLID-DI-Example

I am trying to get to grips with using C# so I thought I would publish my findings, this is very much an adhoc expermintal project, with the only outcome being learning.

## The project specification

This is a pretty basic project that simply convert a numerical value into its string representation, the numerical value should be referred to as the input number and the string representation will be referred to as the output string. The number can be a whole number or a decimal, the number can be a positive or negative.

The input will currently be read from the Console, and the output should be returned to the console.
